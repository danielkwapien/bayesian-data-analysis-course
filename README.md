# Bayesian Data Analysis Coursework

**Final grade: 9.5**
**Practical case grade: 10**

This course consisted in working with statistics from a bayesian point of view. We have seen:
* Conjugate distributions
* Gaussian modeling
* Simulation models for bayesian estimation
* Bayesian linear and non-linear regression models
* Bayesian clustering

It mainly consisted on a conceptual part, pen and paper, and a computational part, with R.

## Practical Case

During the course, we were assigned to work in a practical case and apply some of the bayesian methodologies we learned in class. In my case, I opted for modeling my daily steps, 
extracted from my Apple Fitness data. For it I used a Makov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method with an implementation of the Metropolisâ€“Hastings algorithm.
